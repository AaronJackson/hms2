  <p>If you would like to join a team, the first step is to join slack which you can do at <a href="http://slack.nottignhack.org.uk" target="_blank">slack.nottinghack.org.uk</a></p>

  <p>Once you're on slack, add yourself to the channels that are of interest, then post a message announcing yourself and offering to help.</p>

  <p>There is also more information about the teams on our <a href="https://wiki.nottinghack.org.uk/wiki/Teams" target="_blank">wiki</a>.

  <p>Once you've made contact with the team and are happy you do wish to join, let the trustees know and they will officially add you to the team and it's email group.</p>
