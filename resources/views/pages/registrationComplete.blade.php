  <h4>
    Thank you for registering with Nottingham Hackspace, here is what is going to happen next.
  </h4>
  <p>
    Now you have filled in your details, our membership admins will be notified. They'll give your information a quick check, and if all is well they'll move your membership on to the next stage. If there is an issue, will send you an email with details of what needs correcting.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the part where you get the Nottingham Hackspace bank details, as well as a unique payment reference for your account.<br>
    Use these details to set up a standing order for your membership fee. <br>
    The reference must be used exactly as is when setting up your standing for our automated systems to recognise your membership payments.<br>
    Membership is pay-what-you-like on a monthly basis, and you can always change the amount you're paying if you find yourself using the space more or less than you first thought.
  </p>
  <p>
    With your standing order set-up, your payment will shows up in our bank account. But this may take 3 to 4 days as payments are not instant between all banks and our automated system only checks at midnight on weekdays.<br>
    When it does show, you'll be emailed to say your registration is complete and you're given the door codes. You can then visit the space on the next Wednesday to pick-up your RFID card to get in to the space.<br>
    Once that's done, you are free to visit at any time, twenty four hours a day.
  </p>
  <p>
    A few important details: Nottingham Hackspace is incorporated as a non-profit company, registration number 07766826.<br>
    Everyone who works on stuff for the hackspace is a volunteer; the hackspace has no staff, just members.<br>
    So far, it has also been entirely funded and is self-sustaining through members contributions rather than grants.
