## Hosts File

Most of the development environment is taken care of by vagrant, you just need to `vagrant up` to load it.

You do however need to make changes to your hosts file on your machine. Add the following line to your file:

`192.168.25.35	hmsdev`

You can find your file in the following location:

* Windows: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts
* Mac: /private/etc/hosts
* Linux: /etc/hosts

## Running commands on the Virtual Machine

### Artisan

To run an artisan command on the VM, (for example if you don't have PHP installed on your local machine) use the ```php-artisan``` script that you can find in the dev/ folder.

Simply pass it the artisan command you want to run, e.g:

```./dev/php-artisan make:controller```
